# Breakout Game

This is a Java implementation of the classic Breakout game. Players control a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top. The goal is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball fall past the paddle. The game features smooth controls, dynamic ball speed, and a retro arcade-style design.  

Key Features:  
- Responsive paddle controls for precise gameplay using cursor  
- Multicolered bricks leading to dynamics speed adjustments on the ball
- Real-time collision detection and physics-based ball movement  

This project showcases skills in object-oriented programming, graphical rendering, and interactive gameplay mechanics using Java.
